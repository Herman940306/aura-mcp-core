# Agent Isolation Notice

This workspace is a fully isolated local project.

- Do **not** connect or sync any portion of this codebase with GitHub or other external repositories.
- Treat all tests, integrations, and artifacts as local-only; no remote dependencies are permitted.
- When extending the project, ensure every script, tool, or agent you add keeps this isolation guarantee intact.

Failure to follow this policy will break the owner's requirement for a GitHub-free environment.
